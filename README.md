# yml_gtranslate

yml_gtranslate is a convenience gem for starting your rails localization quickly. It uses the Google Translate service (no API required though).
It creates missing *.yml localization config files or updates the locale file with missing keys and translates them.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'yml_gtranslate', :git => 'git://github.com/zenchief/yml_gtranslate.git'


And then execute:

    $ bundle install

**TODO:**
* not working yet, gotta publish on rubygems 
* Or install it yourself as:
*   $ gem install yml_gtranslate

## Requirements

You need [sed][www.gnu.org/software/sed] on your system and in your $PATH. It's used for handling comment tokens before and after transaltion. 

## Usage

After installation you can translate your files easily just by running a rake task:

```shell
rake yml:gt en de

This is going to take your config/locales/en.yml and compare it with config/locales/de.yml. If it does not exist
it's going to create the yml file and translate all string keys in the source file to German using Google Translate.
If de.yml already exists it's gonna compare all the string keys in both en.yml and de.yml and translate only those missing in de.yml.

The translation adds a comment #i18n-GT after the translated key. This is to let you know, that this string was
generated by Google Translate and probably needs some fine tuning.
