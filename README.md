# yml_gtranslate

yml_gtranslate is a convenience gem for starting your rails localization quickly. It uses the Google Translate service (no API required though).
It creates missing `*.yml` localization config files or updates the locale file with missing keys and translates them.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'yml_gtranslate', :git => 'git://github.com/zenchief/yml_gtranslate.git'


And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yml_gtranslate

## Requirements

You need [sed](www.gnu.org/software/sed) on your system and in your $PATH. It's used for handling comment tokens before and after transaltion. 

## Usage

After installation you can translate your files easily just by a command:


	$ yml_gt <from_lang> <to_lang> [directory]
goes thru all `*from_lang.yml` files in the `direcotry`  
the default dir is config/locales


Translates config/locales/*en.yml files to German

	$ yml_gt en de


Translates all sk.yml files in the _current directory_ to English (hence the dot)

	$ yml_gt sk en .

 

This is going to take your all your `config/locales/*en.yml` files and compare them with `config/locales/*de.yml` files.
(That is in case your locale files are divided, e.g. en.yml, devise.en.yml etc.). If the target file does not exist
it's going to create it and translate all string keys in the source file to German using Google Translate.
If the target file already exists it's gonna compare all the string keys in both source and target and translate only those missing in the target.

The translation adds a comment "#i18n-GT" after the translated key. This is to let you know, that this string was
generated by Google Translate and probably needs some fine tuning.
